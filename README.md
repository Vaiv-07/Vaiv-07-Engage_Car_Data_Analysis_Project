# Engage_Car_Data_Analysis_Project
This is my first data analytics project.

Namaste,
        I'm Vaibhav and I built this project where the problem statement is to analyse the automotive industry's dataset so that the manufacturer can have an idea that what functionality s/he have to use in a car.
        
        I make this project on jupyter notebook in Python language and use the numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
        
        I also use 000webhost platform to deploy my jupyter notebook work's html file.
        
        The "index.html" is the html version of my notebook file.

#### Note :- The website work well on desktop.

Futeure Scope :- We can add multiple plots as our need to get insight from data. We can also add a gui in it which, shows as we clicked on website, have 5 options asking user for what range s/he wants to see insights (using radio buttons).
